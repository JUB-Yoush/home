    I'm Jayden, a computer science student at York University.
    I'm a certified digital thingamabob maker (software developer to some people)

    I've been in love with programming and creating with computers since modifying old Nintendo games and consoles with fan-made hacking tools (don't look for my old starmen.net account, my Earthbound hacks were very bad). 
 
    I got my start proper with using Gamemaker 8 in grade 10 to make simple games, and that's when my interest in programming really began.
  
    Since then I've founded York's game development club ([gdyu.club](https://www.gdyu.club/)), learned full-stack development, got good at OOP, and have experience with many different tools and languages (see my [resume!!](/resume)).

   
    I'm a fan of programming in many forms, and am always looking for opportunities to use code to make interesting, expressive, artistic, and cool stuff.


    When I'm not looking for work or running my club, you can find me <a class="hobby-anchor" href="javascript:;" on:click={next_hobby}>{current_hobby}.</a>
