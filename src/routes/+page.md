While you're here, feel free to learn more [about me](/about) about me, check out what I'm [up to](/projects) or what I'm [thinking about](/blog).


If you're a recruiter who's found this link though my linkedin or resume, then you should definitely consider [hiring](/resume) me, currently interning at Scotiabank, but looking for Winter and Summer 2024 positions.


Regardless, thanks for checking out my site, feel free to reach out!
