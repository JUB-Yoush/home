This is a new kind of post. Although considering I've only made 3 posts before this, there really isn't a status quo to break. It's one of those posts that's reserved for the biggest jaydenpb heads.

Get ready for a LONG one 

I'm going to tell you what I was up to, and what I'll be up to. 

I usually write this in my Journal, writing daily, weekly, and seasonal goals. But for those of you who are curious and for the extra added accountability of sharing what I'm doing publicly, I thought I'd be a interesting idea to share the seasonal goals with all (3?) of you.

But before we get into what I'm going to do, we need to talk about what I did, and how many of the goals for the fall I was able to accomplish. 

prepare for a long post.

## Previous Season Reflection (Fall 2023)
the catagories are as follows:
- Work/School
- GDYU
- Hobbies/Personal
- Health


I did a good job (yay!!!). I was able to get a lot of good and important work done, although I feel quite short on the amount of personal/hobby work I was able to accomplish. 

## School/Work

The biggest thing for me was Securing 8 more months of internships, which I was able to do. I'll be going to another team in scoitabank for the winter, and I'll be participating in the RBC amplify program as a developer in the summer. 

For my current internship, I've been doing a great job. my manager had said I could return for another 4 months, (although I chose to do another 4 months in another team.) Me and 2 other's are working on a big end of term project right now so I'm confident enough in giving a brief review of my time at Scotiabank on the Application Security Team.

Not exactly sure how much I can share but-

### Brief review of my Scotiabank AppSec Engineering Internship
Linux Goats all around me. I was concerned that we were going to be coding on locked-down bank Thinkpads that you had to send a request to install ANYTHING on (aside: Thinkpad names after 2020 are terrible and they should've just wrapped around to calling them T400's again or something.). Other dev teams had been using macbooks, and some teams from our department also had macbooks. 

I asked if we were going to be coding in windows, turns out my team works in... Linux? They had come up with a workaround to Thinkpad development involving asking to install virtualbox, and doing everything inside a virtual machine. It worked quite well, and bypassed a lot of the bureaucracy in corportate development. I had superuser privileges and could do whatever I wanted.

Thing is, the senior dev on my team was big on everyone knowing what they were doing. So there was a MASSIVE document on our teams documentation about ALL the steps you needed to:
- start a linux vm.
- make a shared folder with the windows install.
- partition your drives manually.
- set up the bank proxy so we could access internal tools.


It was a lot. And I had to do it Twice (They tell you to give yourself a drive of 10GB???? So when I went to add more space). 

But it worked! and I could do whatever I wanted to in it. I was also nice that our main dev environment was in linux because we worked a lot with linux servers. Lots of ssh'ing and working in the terminal (All my years of using Vim for fun finally paid off). Became much more comfortable with working in the terminal, and I also started to use Docker, something I probably wouldn't have ever thought about in my own personal projects, but being in a DevOps team has Shown me the value (Writing my own images and containers for ALL my big projects from now on.) 

Our big term project is making a Next.js app to allow the team to simplify getting software scan data. I had wanted to use SvelteKit but the other two interns had no experience with svelte, but did have experience with react, so I picked Next.js instead.

My team is also great! My senior manager is really cool and we bonded over Quake and Godot and... Strong Bad from Homestar Runner? The Senior Development lead was also very cool and inspirational. He's the 2nd person I've seen who uses the i3 tiling window manager, with the other being james (the study guy). I have installed i3 on my framework laptop (more on that later), but I'm too embarrassed (and he's to hard at work) for me to sit down and tell him he inspired me to give it a try.

Overall great time, I'm moving to the java event layer team, and it seems like they use a lot of Boomer legacy tech there. It's in the digital department, which is the hip modern tech sister office down the street, and it also means I'm working on systems that end-users interact with. so Let's see how that goes.

Okay I think that's it.

As for school, I was doing this full time co-op so not much to report.

Also got back into leetcode. (fill this out)

## GDYU

GDYU did great from september through November. I expected the server to pick up activity once summer rolled around and such was the case. We had a tremendous turnout at Yorkfest (the club tabling event in september), with having over (like 160 but find the number) new members join the server. We did a giveaway for some scrimblo merch (which we still have not released).

My goal this seasons was consistency. come up with piplines and ways we work and orginize things to ensure things go as we'd like them to and we can have a consistent amount of events and things for our members. Although things still do kinda operate under a "it'd be cool if we did x" and then x happens, we have a lot of staple events, like our semester end jams, GESC, yudum dare, GDCYU, and the drawpile evenings. 

Our Unity workshops in November also showed us that there are holes for GDYU to fill in the Digital Media department. GDYU is still quite separate from the Digital Media and game development departments at york and that's something I'm still trying to fix.

There's also our lack of social presence, we don't really have social media, we also don't really use lassonde channels for advertising which also stiffles the amount of reach we can recieve. 

We also Launched [wiki.gdyu.club](""), a markdown book that has archives of workshops and resources from GDYU members for GDYU members. I hope other people start contributing to it soon, Github workflows aren't *that* hard to operate... right?

I'm VERY happy with our executive team and am excited for the new things GDYU will be up to.


## Personal/Hobby Work.

This is where the sacrifices went unfortunately. I consider the work I spend my time on in 3 tiers: Work I'm obligated to do (like school/job work), work other people benefit from (like GDYU), and work I do for myself because I enjoy it. 

When time is limited and I have to choose I'm generally going to focus on the work that can benefit others (when it comes to school and my job, I don't usually have a choice lol). 

I had a few goals this season, one of them was to get more confident with backend web development, something I though I'd have to spend time making practice projects for, but I've found hackathons and my work at work to be great times to practice skills like server side code, api's, and databases. Although I'm not at the point I'd like to be, I'm confident I'll be able to learn things as I need to use them.

Another was to try to get into lower-level development, specifically with Rust. I had been working through the rust book, and the rust community has come up with all sorts of interesting and cool ways to go about teaching rust. I think low level development is interesting, because I'd like to get a better idea of exactly what my code is doing. I wanted to build an emulator, specifically for the chip-8, (although technically it would be a chip-8 interpreter) and also potentially the GameBoy. I've done neither. I think the idea is cool but I'm spending my time elsewhere.

In a similar vein, I also wanted to get a better understanding of the godot game engine. I want to learn how it works, and get familiar with the source code. Being a godot contributor would be extremely cool, and It's something I'd like to be able to do. I have done 0 looking at the godot source code, and I've barley worked on any godot projects I do have one interesting game idea but I haven't been able to give it the time it deserves. I really hope this changes next season.

I also picked Drawing back up, as I wanted to spend time on a hobby that didn't involve programming.  This happened during the season so I had no specific goals set. But I resumed DrawaBox from my 9-month long Hiatus since my [lesson 4 bug drawings](""), and because Drawabox forces you to spend 50% of your total drawing time on drawing for fun, I wanted to get to work on some Comics! I've always loved Comics and manga, and I think they'll be a great way for me to practice my drawing. I've been keeping track of characters and worldbuilding with [obsidian](""), and read [Understanding Comics]("") and [Making Comics]("") by Scott lastname, they might be some of my favorite books of all time, as comics about comics, scott's level of understanding is unmatched, demonstratable by his extremley easy to understand explainations of ideas that likley took him years to distill into the form they're in now. I recommend understanding comics to anyone who reads comics or manga and wants to understand the nuances we usually never consider, and making comics to those who're interested in giving them a try. I won't spend too much time talking about these books as I'll likely release a book review on them in a future post.

## Other cool things I did.

My Framework 13 finally showed up. It's really nice and ironically most resembles a Macbook. I'd give a more in-depth review but I'll save it for it's own post later. That and I've barley used the thing aside from (mostly) setting up i3. I've just been at home a lot these days and use my desk setup.

I also got a steam deck around last week! I got it so that I could potentially sit in other areas of my house instead of my desk to play my games (I spend like 13 hours a day at my desk lol), it'll also allow me to bring my games around, which is nice. It's a 256gb LCD model, as the OLED revision has people selling their old ones. I'd give a review but I won't for exactly the same reasons as the framework laptop.

I also went to my first concert!!! I saw Sungazer at the Axis club with the only other Sungazer fan I knew who also happened to be a good friend (thank you for existing, other Sungazer fan friend, and paying for half my uber home because the GO train stopped running at 11pm on weekdays. I appreciate you.). The show was great, Jazz fusion lends itself well to live performances being very different from the recordings you're used to listening too. Not sure when another artist I'm interested in will be playing in Toronto, but I'll try to make it!

okay 2000+ words and 210 vite reloads later we can now get into the second half of this post. Where I talk about the things I'm GOING TO (want to) do.

This is a great place to take a break, if you've made it this far, thank you.
