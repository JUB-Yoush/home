# こんにちは！　こんばんは！

ジェイデンだ, これが私のブログ！

私の日本語がいくない。。。

I plan on going on exchange to Tokyo in September. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to pick up on japanese, I'm taking classes in english but I'd be in Japan so I'd have lot of opportunities to practice.

If you've heard anything about self studying language it's that it's a horribly ambitious endeavour fraught with hardship, especially one as different as japanese. I'll get into the perceived (and actual, there is a lot of actual) difficulties of learning languages later on, but why do I want to learn Japanese?

Well I like japanese things, lot of my favorite media and technology was made in or inspired by japanese things. I think the language would be a step in trying to demystify place, and get a better understanding of the culture. Our thoughts are restricted in only being able to think things that can be expressed in the words we know. Maybe japanese will allow me to unlock new japan-y ways of thinking?

Japanese is a language, the use of a language being to communicate thoughts and ideas with other humans. Having a "hobby" (I'll elaborate on the quote use later) like Japanese, something that is based in interacting with people, could help me connect with others (and go outside more).

Also being able to view the unfiltered version of a creators artistic vision would be cool. I'll play Tokimeki Memorial 2 someday (certainly before Tim get's to reviewing it).

This post will be about my observations of the language based on what I've encountered so far. I expect things will be incorrect, as my gaijin-ahh opinions are based in (as of writing this) only knowing about 70% of the grammar points needed for the N5 certification, the simplest "knowns some basic japanese" certification you can get.

From my time with the language so far, japanese is a tremendously interesting, logical, and compelling language to want to learn and to want to use. It's a lot of work, but It's been very fun :)

However it's based in a logic very different from that of English or other European languages.

So what's up with japanese?

## 仮名 KANA: Japan's Alphabet (or lack thereof)
The first thing you'll notice about japanese is that the squiggles we're used to deriving meaning from are gone. Instead are wildy different looking runes we must decypher. The alphabet we know is gone, and there is no alphabet to replace it. Instead, japanese is built on a syllabary.
A syllabary is a collection of symbols that represent syllables. Each symbol (kana) in japanese is a Syllable, with a constant at the front and a vowel at the end.

some examples are:
K + A = か (KA)
N + A = な (NA)
かな = Kana!!!

Japanese is also phonetically consistent! That means every Kana is pronounced the same way no matter what word it's used in. There is no guesswork in how a word sounds, unlike english and it's 7 ways to pronounce the letters "ough".

Wow japanese seems like a well thought out language free of any redundancies or needless complexity!

Well...

### Two sets of kana
The example kana I wrote were in the **Hirigana** Kana Set. It's the default japanese character set and the first one you'll learn.
There is also another set of Kana, **Katakana**.
It behaves exactly the same way as Hirigana, but is commonly used for loaned foreign words and food. has a few extra sound combinations to help.

Foreign words are frequently lossy converted from their language to Katakana. Japanese might not have all the sounds needed to pronounce that word exactly, so they'll need to get compressed to fix into japanese syllables. My name for example:

Jayden in Katakana is ジェイデン
The Katakana written in romanji (japanese written with the english alphabet) is ジェイデン = JIEIDEN

Learning the syllabaries might seem like a lot more work compared languages that use the roman alphabet, but it'll only take like, a day each. You'll also get a lot of practice with them so they'll become grokked pretty quickly. Hirigana faster then Katakana though.

So just learn two sets of like 70 symbols and then I can read whatever I see right?

right?

Remember how I alluded to redundancies earlier?

## 漢字 KANJI
Kanji are chinese characters that are a hold-over from when japanese was forked from chinese. Each Kanji is a unique symbol that has a kana reading and meaning attached with it.

For example: the Kanij for "I" (as in the first person pronoun) is 私, and it's reading is し.

There are in total: 85,000 Kanji according to the (link) in the history of all time forever.

That's a lot to learn.

However there are *only* 2136 kanji in the joyo kanji guide used by the japanese ministry of education.

significantly less! but still over two thousand.

Some kanji feel especially redundant, considering it takes so many more strokes to write then it's equivalent kana reading (find a good example)

You might also be curious about how these kanji are organized, and how to look them up?

Each kanji is unique so We don't have the luxury of just typing in the characters were familiar with unlike unfamiliar english words, or kanji with furigana (the hirigana is written on top).

Kanji are generally organized by stroke order, but that just groups them, and you'd also need to be familiar with the stroke count of kanji

but there is another system that we can use to break down and identify kanji:

### Radicals!!
Radicals are the individual shapes used to make up kanji, know your radicals and you can use them to not only look up kanji based on the radicals they use, but also use the names of each radical to help make mnemonics to help with memorizing all those kanji

Kanji are a major hurdle in japanese learning, and being able to identify and recall them will take a lot of deliberate practice and memorization.

But it's simple!

Sure it might take time to learn them all, but it's not a complicated process.

Just put about 2300+ characters in your head and you're are now at a french learners day 0

*Kinda*

## 訓読み VS 音読み KUNYOMI VS ONYOMI
When japanese was forking from chinese they needed to resolve the merge conflicts between the existing chinese kanji meanings and the new japanese kanji meanings they were coming up with. Instead of chosing to reject or embrace traiditon, they simply chose to not choose, and kept both meanings.

Surprise! Each Kanji has a *Kun* Reading and *On* Reading.

the general rule is:
- if it's a word that has two or more kanji next to each other, it uses their On (The Kanji reading you already learned) reading
- if the Kanji is alone or separated by a particle like (の), use the Kun (The new vocab reading) reading
( simple examples)

So you need to memorize 2136 * 2 readings? Not nessicarily. Some Kanji have the same Kun and On Readings, while some have multiple different Kun and On Readings, the Kanji for life has 20 different ways it could be read depending on the word it's in.

Kanji are not words. They are used to make words, and some words are just single kanji, however Kanji are not inertly words. This makes Kanji sound even more cumbersome then they already were, and some even promote the idea of learning kanji just through vocabulary and skipping learning them by themselves.


### Rendaku
Going back to Hirigana and Katakana quickly, some Kana can have the constant before the vowel modified by adding a ” or ° to it:
(examples)

Rendaku is when these modifiers are added to a word that usually doesn't have one, in a seemingly inconsistent manner.
(example)
although it [isn't inconsistient](link), you'll likely just end up memorizing which words get rendaku'ed or not.

## grammar.
so you've memorized 2000+ kanji and 6000+ vocabulary words!
time to use them!

There are no spaces in japanese. Reading japanese can *sometimes* be a nightmare.
Because there is no separation between where one word ends and another one begins, you need to become a regular expression algorithm that trys to chunk together which kana are parts of which word, and which kana are used for particles.
(example)

There are some helpful rules like verbs always end with "U" vowel kana
(examples)

and adjectives always end with い

and Kanji does make this regexing *a bit* easier, as the kana in a kanji will never be used as a grammar particle.

...I think?

Also, words that can be implied through context are frequently omitted in speech, sorta like how if someone asks a group of people their major, they would just say "Business" instead of "my major is business", as the first part is implied.

imagine that situation but used for the entire language all the time.

English is a Subject Verb Object Language:
" I eat the apple"
I = Subject
Eat = Verb
Apple = Object

Japanese is commonly labeled as a Subject Object Verb language, and it's sorta like that, 

the verb is the thing that the entire sentence is structured around, using words with grammar particles in between to signifiy how they relate to the verb


## immersion != learning
A little note on learning, not only japanese but language in general. Languages are fundamental to the human experience, our brains are hard-wired to be able to pick up on them as fast as possible, as language is essential to communication, which is essential to survival. Language is nessicarily to inform your fellow tribe members to keep themselves from pre-maturely exiting the gene pool.

But then why is language learning so difficult for so many people? It's because our brains only treat languages as languages when *we* treat them as languages, not just as a hobbies, but the means in which we must communicate ideas.

Immersion is great for language learning, not from absorbing the language though osmosis, but because you have the opportunity to treat the language as the primary means of communication. There are lots of people who live in Tokyo for years and don't pick up on any japanese, because of the abundance of english, they don't need to ever treat japanese like a language (Tokyo might be the easiest place to navigate without knowing the language in the entire world).

So is "genuine" language learned reserved for only those who have the luxury to spend time pysically immersed in a country in which their target language is spoken? 

No

Of course being in a place where you language is spoken would help a lot, but you're unable to be in a physical space, you can find places in the things you do that can be boxed off from english, to make the pimrary means of communication your target language. 

Some examples of this boxing off could be:
- All video games/Anime/Manga must be consumed in japanese
- Follow Blogs or Content creators who only make content in your language 
- Make a Dungeons and Dragons party of other japanese language learners and only play in that language (I actually am interested in doing this, not nearly good enough yet, but HMU if you're also interested)
- Follow blogs or YouTubers that only post in japanese.
- VR chat?
- Go to language exchanges and make friends that only communicate in japanese

You want to create spaces where your language is the primary means of communication, even if that "space" isn't a place where it's commonly used.
