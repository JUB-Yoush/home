# こんにちは！　こんばんは！

ジェイデンだ, これが私のブログ！

私の日本語がいくない。。。

I plan on going on exchange to Tokyo in September. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to pick up on japanese, I'm taking classes in english but I'd be in Japan so I'd have lot of opportunities to practice.

If you've heard anything about self studying language it's that it's a horribly ambitious endeavour fraught with hardship. I'll get into the perceived (and actual, not to insinuate all the difficulty of learning Japanese is perceived) difficulties of learning languages later on, but why do I want to learn Japanese?

Why learn japanese? Well I like japanese things. Although considering I've been able to engage with japanese things though english translations as of now, that couldn't be the entire answer. A lot of my favorite media and technology was made in japan or inspired by japanese things. I think the language would be a step in trying to demystify place, and get a better understanding of the culture and it's values. The Language we speak frames our thoughts after all, some might consider the fact that we are restricted in only being able to think things that are able to be quantified and expressed in words. Maybe japanese will allow me to unlock new japan-y ways of thinking?

Japanese is also a language, the goal of a language being to communicate thoughts and ideas with other humans. Having a "hobby" (I'll elaborate on the quote use later) that is based in interacting with people could help me connect with others and go outside more lol.

Also being able to view the unfiltered version of a creators vision in their work would be cool. I'll play Tokimeki memorial 2 someday.

this post will be about my observations of the language based on what I've encountered so far. I expect things will be incorrect, as my gaijin-ahh opinions are based in (as of writing this) only knowing 70% of the grammar points needed for the N5 certification, the simplest "knowns some basic japanese" you can get.

anyway,

## 仮名 KANA: Japan's Alphabet (or lack thereof)
The first thing you'll notice about japanese is that the squigles we're used to deriving meaning from are gone. Instead are wildy different looking runes we must decypher. The alphabet we know is gone, and there is no alphabet to replace it. Instead, japanese is built on a syllabary.
A syllabary is a collection of symbols that represent syllabes. Each symbol (kana) in japanese is a Syllable, with a constant at the front and a vowel at the end.

some examples are:
K + A = か (KA)
N + A = な (NA)
かな = Kana!!!

Each kana is pronounced with a constant rhythm.

Might I add: Japanese is also phonetically consistent! That means every Kana is pronounced the same way no matter what word it's used in. There is no guesswork in how a word sounds, unlike english and it's 7 ways to pronounce the letters "ough".

That along with each kana being spoken in a constant rhythm helps give japanese it's distinct sound

Wow japanese seems like a well thought out language free of any redundancies or needless complexity!

Well...

### Two sets of kana
The example kana I wrote were in the **Hirigana** Kana Set. It's the default japanese character set and the first one you learn.
There is also another set of Kana, **Katakana**.
It behaves exactly the same way as Hirigana, but has a few extra sound combinations to help with foreign words used in Japanese.

It's also used for Food.

Foreign words are frequently lossy converted from their language to Katakana, It's lossy because Japanese might not have all the sounds needed to pronouce that word exactly, so they'll need to get compressed to fix into japanese syllables. My name for example:

Jayden in Katakana is ジェイデン
The Katakana written in romanji (japanese written with the english alphabet) is ジェイデン = JIEIDEN

Learning the silibaires might seem like a lot more work compared to languages that use the roman alphabet, but it'll only take like, a day each. You'll also get a lot of practice with them so they'll become grokked pretty quickly. Hirigana faster then Katakana.

So after that you can read whatever I see right?
you're at like, a french learners day 0 right?

right?

remember how I alluded to redundancies earlier?

## 漢字 KANJI
There are in total: 85,000 Kanji according to the (link) in the history of all time forever.

that's obviously absurd.

However there are *only* 2136 kanji in the joyo kanji guide used by the japanese ministry of education.

significantly less! but still over two thousand.

Kanji are chinese characters that are a hold-over from when japanese was forked from chinese. Each Kanji is a unique symbol that has a kana reading and meaning attached with it.

for example: the Kanij for "I" (as in the first person pronoun) is 私, and it's reading is し.
絨毯
some kanji feel especially redundant, considering it takes so many more strokes to write then it's equivalent kana reading (find a good example)

you might also be curious about how these kanji are organized, and how to look them up? each kanji is unique so We don't have the luxury of just typing in the characters were familiar with unlike unfamiliar english words, or kanji with furigana (the hirigana is written on top).

well they're generally organized by stroke order, but that just narrows it down and you'd also need to be familiar with the stroke count of kanji

but there is another system that we can use to break down and identify kanji

### Radicals!!
Radicals are the individual shapes used to make up kanji, know your radicals and you can use them to not only look up kanji based on the radicals they use, but also use the names of each radical to help make mnemonics to help with getting 2136 symbols in your head

(put good example)

Kanji are a major hurdle in japanese learning, and being able to identify and recall them will take a lot of deliberate practice and memorization.

But it's simple right?

Sure it might take time to learn them all, but it's not a complicated process.

fit them all in your head and you are now at a french learners day 0, *kinda*

## 訓読み VS 音読み KUNYOMI VS ONYOMI
When japanese was forking from chinese they needed to resolve the merge conflicts between the existing chinese kanji meanings and the new japanese kanji meanings they were coming up with. Instead of chosing to reject or embrace traiditon, they simply chose to not choose, and kept both meanings.

Surprise! Each Kanji has a Kun Reading and On Reading.

So you need to memorize 2136 * 2 readings? Not nessicarily. Some Kanji have the same Kun and On Readings, while some have multiple different Kun and On Readings, the Kanji for life has 20 different ways it could be read depending on the word it's in.

Kanji are not words. They are used to make words, and some words are just kanji by themselves, however Kanji are not inertly words. This makes Kanji sound a lot less useful then you might've thought, but the meanings and readings of kanji come together to form words!

the general rule is:
- if it's a word that has two or more kanji next to each other, it uses their On (The Kanji reading you already learned) reading
- if the Kanji is alone or separated by a particle like (の), use the Kun (The new vocab reading) reading
( simple examples)

### Rendaku
- somtimes they add a sqigly.
- it's not consistent

## grammar.
- engish is subject verb object
- japanese is described as sov
- that's not nessicarily the case
- it's actually like:
- navigating japanese is a regex nightmare
- there are no spaces
- you need to collect potential word matches and figure out which ones make the sentence?
- (most of the time) the answer is fairly clear based on context and the other potential sentences not making any sense
- kanji does come in handy (a bit), because particles are always in hirigana and not kanji.


## immersion != learning
- a common misconception is that immersion is what allows you to learn a language.
- just being around a language dosen't mean you'll engage with it
- there are ppl who move and live in tokyo for years without learning any jp
- tokyo might be the easiest place to navigate without knowing the language of the place, as there is also english everywhere.
- immersion is only valueable if you treat the language you're immersed in as a language.
- language is essential to communication, which is essential to survival. It's improtant to inform your fellow tribe members to keep themselves from pre-maturley exiting the gene pool.
- people who are able to go to a foreign place and only allow themselves to communicate in that language find rapid succsess because the brain treats it like a language.
- now even if you aren't fortuniate enough to travel to japan, you can still take this idea an apply it to your japanese
- find areas in your life or hobbies you engage in, and gate them off to only be able to interact with those things in japanese.
- more detail abt that


## wait what have I gotten myself into
- japanese is hard?
- is learning any language hard?
- I have no point of reference, and it's been not that bad so far
- learning languages starts simple but gets exponentially more difficult
