# こんにちは！　こんばんは！

ジェイデンだ, これが私のブログ！

私の日本語がいくない。。。

I going on exchange to Tokyo in September. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to pick up on japanese, I'm taking classes in english but I'd be in Japan so I'd have lot of opportunities to practice.

If you've heard anything about self studying language it's that it's a horribly ambitious endeavour fraught with hardship. I'll get into the percieved (and actual) difficulties of learning languages later on, but why do I want to learn Japanese?

I like japanese things. Although considering I've been able to engage with japanese things though english translations as of now, that couldn't be the entire answer. A lot of my favorite media and technology was made in japan or inspired by japanese things. I think the language would be a step in trying to demystify place, and get a better understanding of the culture and it's values. The Language we speak frames our thoughts after all, some might consider the fact that we are restricted in only being able to think things that are able to be quantified and expressed in words. Maybe japanese will allow me to unlock new ways of thinking?

Japanese is also a language, the goal of a language being to communicate thoughts and ideas with other humans. Having a "hobby" (I'll elaborate on the quote use later) that is based in interacting with people could help me connect with others and go outside more lol.

Also being able to view the unfiltered version of a creators vision in their work would be cool. I need to play Tokimeki memorial 2 or something.

this post will be about my observations of the language based on what I've encountered so far. I expect things will be incorrect, as my gaijin-ahh opinions are based in only knowing 70% of the grammar points needed for the N5 certification, the simplest "knowns some basic japanese" you can get.

anyway,

## 仮名 KANA The Alphabet (or lack thereof)
The first thing you'll notice about japanese is that the squigles we're used to deriving meaning from are gone. Instead are wildy different looking runes we must decypher. There is no alphabet in japanese. Instead japanese is built on a syllabary.
A syllabary is symbols that represent syllabes. Each symbol (kana) in japanese is a Syllable, with a constant at the front and a vowel at the end.

some examples are:
K + A = か (KA)
N + A = な (NA)
かな = Kana!!!

Might I add Japanese is also phonetically consistent. That means every Kana is pronounced the same way no matter what word it's used in. There is no guesswork in how a word sounds, unlike english and it's 7 ways to pronounce the letters "ough".

This helps give japanese it's distinct sound, as there aren't *that many* different sounds you make in the language.

Wow japanese seems like a well thought out language free of any redundancies or needless complexity!

Well...

### Two sets of kana
The example kana I wrote were in the **Hirigana** Kana Set. It's the default japanese character set, and it's used for grammar particles.
There is also another set of Kana, **Katakana**.
It behaves exactly the same way as Hirigana, but has a few extra sound combinations to help with foreign words used in Japanese.
It's also used for Food.
Foreign words are frequently "lossy converted" from their language to Katakana, It's lossy because Japanese might not have all the sounds needed to keep that word exactly as it was. They'll need to get compressed to fix into japanese syllables. My name for example:
Jayden = ジェイデン
ジェイデン = JIEIDEN

Learning the silibaires might seem like a lot more work compared to languages that use the roman alphabet, but it'll only take like, a few days. You'll also get a lot of practice with them so they'll become grokked pretty quickly. Hirigana faster then Katakana.

So after that you can read whatever I see right?
you're at like a french learners day 0 right?

right?

remember how I alluded to redundancies earlier?

## 漢字 KANJI
There are in total: 85,000 Kanji according to the (link) in the history of all time forever.

that's obviously absurd.

however there are *only* 2136 kanji in the joyo kanji guide used by the japanese ministry of education.

Kanji are chinese characters that are a hold-over from when japanese was forked from chinese.


- die.
- characters taken from chinese
- there are apparently 47,000
- but the ministry of education considers the standard set *only* 2136
- it takes schoolchildren 9-10 years to learn those 2k+
- it's hard
- but it's incredibly simple! just learn them all!
- okay I've memorized all 2k+ and their meanings, I'm now able to read japanese right???
you are now at a french learners day 0.

## 訓読み VS 音読み KUNYOMI VS ONYOMI
- when japanese was forking from chinese they needed to resolve the merge conflicts between the existing chinese meanings and the new japanese meanings
- did they stick with the old ones or go to the new?
- why not keep both. for all of them.
- actually let's just have like 20 readings for the kanji life (生)
- if it's by itself it's kun
- if it's a group on

### Rendaku
- somtimes.

## grammar.
- engish is subject verb object
- japanese is described as sov
- that's not nessicarily the case
- it's actually like:
- navigating japanese is a regex nightmare
- there are no spaces
- you need to collect potential word matches and figure out which ones make the sentence?
- (most of the time) the answer is fairly clear based on context and the other potential sentences not making any sense
- kanji does come in handy (a bit), because partciles are always in hirigana and not kanji.


## immersion != learning
- a common misconception is that immersion is what allows you to learn a language.
- just being around a language dosen't mean you'll engage with it
- there are ppl who move and live in tokyo for years without learning any jp
- tokyo might be the easiest place to navigate without knowing the language of the place, as there is also english everywhere.
- immersion is only valueable if you treat the language you're immersed in as a language.
- language is essential to communication, which is essential to survival. It's improtant to inform your fellow tribe members to keep themselves from pre-maturley exiting the gene pool.
- people who are able to go to a foreign place and only allow themselves to communicate in that language find rapid succsess because the brain treats it like a language.
- now even if you aren't fortuniate enough to travel to japan, you can still take this idea an apply it to your japanese
- find areas in your life or hobbies you engage in, and gate them off to only be able to interact with those things in japanese.
- more detail abt that


## wait what have I gotten myself into
- japanese is hard?
- is learning any language hard?
- I have no point of reference, and it's been not that bad so far
- learning languages starts simple but gets exponentially more difficult
