Greetings, children, gather around as I divulge my wisen lived knoledge onto your consciousnesses, enriching your lives and ensuring the pipline to the deep work uptopia is well stocked.

What am I talking about? Well I've been wanting to review books, among other things, but I think there have been a lot of books that have had profound impacts on how I work, think, and live my life. And I'd like to share some recomendations and anecdotes about them.

Books are good because they **take a while to make**. In an information economy where a reply to a tweet can be thought up in less than a minute, being able to listen to the distilled and crystallized thoughts, knowledge, and opinions of authors allows you to get a nuanced, information dense, and holistic understanding of what they're talking about and how they feel. Books are good!

For this first book review I'll be reviewing 2 books. Both of them were very formative for me, and have changed some fundamental thoughts I had about myself and how things worked.

This book (despite the [ugly cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mVZQLTTlL._SL1500_.jpg)) is great!

I had stumbled upon it from someone in a reddit post recomending the coursera course adaptation of the book (which I still have my [notes from](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3taAYqe1AK1C0XW5mJgFT1JO5whZH5JFtk8nW_8JvA/edit?usp=sharing)), which fundamentally changed the way I approached studying, being "smart" and doing well in school. I was so interested I got the book to get the full-fat, unabridged version.

We are never taught how to study. At least I wasn't. None of the lessons in this book were given to me by anyone before, of course I got the basic "review is important" and other things from teachers and seniors, but I had never had something so deep and actionable.
