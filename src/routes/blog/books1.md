Greetings, children, gather around as I divulge my wisen lived knoledge onto your consciousnesses, enriching your lives and ensuring the pipline to the deep work uptopia is well stocked.

What am I talking about? Well I've been wanting to review books, among other things, but I think there have been a lot of books that have had profound impacts on how I work, think, and live my life. And I'd like to share some recomendations and anecdotes about them.

Books are good because they **take a while to make**. In an information economy where a reply to a tweet can be thought up in less than a minute, being able to listen to the distilled and crystallized thoughts, knowledge, and opinions of authors allows you to get a nuanced, information dense, and holistic understanding of what they're talking about and how they feel. Books are good!

For this first book review I'll be reviewing 2 books. Both of them were very formative for me, and have changed some fundamental thoughts I had about myself and how things worked.

## A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)
### Prof Barbara Oakley
This book (despite the [ugly cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mVZQLTTlL._SL1500_.jpg)) is great!

I had stumbled upon it from someone in a reddit post recomending the coursera course adaptation of the book (which I still have my [notes from](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3taAYqe1AK1C0XW5mJgFT1JO5whZH5JFtk8nW_8JvA/edit?usp=sharing)), which fundamentally changed the way I approached studying, being "smart" and doing well in school. I was so interested I got the book to get the full-fat, unabridged version.

We are never taught how to study. At least I wasn't. None of the lessons in this book were given to me by anyone before, of course I got the basic "review is important" and other things from teachers and seniors, but I had never had something so deep and actionable. It helped teach me to study, showed me that there wasn't anything fundamentally different between me and the "smart" kids, and it taught me how to learn.

Prof Barbara Oakley works in Engineering and Neuroscience, transitioning into that from a past of working in Language and culture. Quite the career shift, and she knows that. She had a childhood of resenting math and science, labeling herself as being unfit for it. Her time in the military helped her see all the opportunities STEM knowledge can provide, and decided to look inward and try to shift her thinking towards a growth mindset. This change brought about her studying engineering, as well as neuroscience, to understand how exactly the brain goes about learning.

I read this book around 2 years ago (the notes are from July 2021), and I think the lessons that have stuck with me and I continuate to actively apply from then to now are:

### Focused and Diffused Modes of thinking.
Your brain has two general modes of thinking, Focused thinking and Diffused thinking. Focused thinking is generally what what we think of when we study, you're focused on trying to do a single task as well as possible. Diffused thinking is the thinking that happens in the background when we aren't actively working on anything, it's subconscious and allows your brain to process the things you put into it and reach new creative conclusions. The goal is to switch between diffused and focused modes of thinking to leverage the power of both types, using study setups like the pomodoro method (50 minute study sessions and 10 minute breaks, or 25:5 if you prefer.) to cultivate both types of thinking. 

Diffused thinking was a revelation to me, considering it would be hard to tell that anything is happening in your subconscious, it was interesting to know how much studying can happen outside of the studying. It also ties into the idea of spaced repetition, you need to swtich between focused and diffused thinking to allow you to build a foundatino in what you're studying, maybe this should be a seperate section 

### Chunking
We don't think about habitual tasks like Walking or Speaking our native language anymore. Someone who's learned a song on a instrument dosen't think about every indivisual note. we "chunk" them and it's been placed in our long term memory. It's like Zipping a file in a computer folder, we don't think about grammar or sentence structure or the tense of verbs when we speak anymore, we just know it well enough to do it without thinking about it. Chunking allows you to focus on other things while the neural pathways that are fluent at whatever task they do can fire away in the background.

### Procrastiation.
Our brains want to protect us form things we think will be painful. Procrastinating from work is our brain trying to protect us from percived pain. The thing is, people who start to work on somthing usualy have the "pain" go away very quickly, around 5-10 minutes of working on it. If I'm ever feeling like I don't want to work on somthing, I'll set a timer for 5 minutes and force myself to do it, after the 5 minutes, if I don't feel like continuing to work on it, I have no obligation to and can stop. but most of the time I continute to work on it, after the "pain" has left.

### Todo lists
our brains have very limited ram, it's important to offload things to other places so we can clear it up. try to write down your tasks in a todo list. pick the 3 most important ones to do that day, and try to get those done at least. anything after that is a bonus.
