- good software is worth your money
- big tech makes prjducts that work good enough, and condition us to expect free things
- its like mass processed food vs a farmers market ig
- no ownership no repair all that wack-ness
- attention economy, make money off our addictions
- what I like in my software
- unity vs godot stuff
- not saying all of big tech is inertly evil, these products have improved our lives
- and there are some things that requires the scale of big tech, like google maps
- but there are people making good software that respects you n stuff and you should check it out!

Good software is important. 

One of my goals before I die is to make the world a better place then I had found it. which isn't really practical considering all of the factors outside my control. I'm one person, and the influence I have is relatively small. It's also quite difficult to quantify the "quality" of the "entire world", so instead of trying to improve everything, I should just stick to somthing. find a plot of land in this "world" that I would want to improve, and tend to it, and make it better.

Software is unique because it's functionally infinitely reproducable (assuming in infinite number of storage), meaning it will always eventually be more valuable then the effort it took to make it. This gives software the ability to be trenedously valuable, and could allow one person or a handful of people to improve the lives of a seemingly unbounded amount of people.

And that's what's happened time and time again within the last few decades. we've seen software that is able to revolutionize how things are done, to how we live our lives. It's strange to think of a time without the internet especially if you never knew a time without one.

and jobs with large social and societal impact are conpensated as such. high paying professions are (usually) compensated as such due to the trust and responsibility people put into the ones who make the things they rely and depend on. Civil engineers are paid as they are because we trust them to make bridges that don't collapse, surgeons are trusted to be able to preform brain surgery. and Software engineers are paid as they are to capuitulate to corpos aint that the truth  

both those kinds of software are tremendously important for our day to day lives, and we all to varying degrees rely on them. however there has been a clear and quite concerning change in how this software is sold and maintained that is indicative of societal changes.

Free software from large companies relies on advertisement to make money, they're incentivised to keep you on their platforms as long as possible. this can obviously be seen in smartphone addiction and other things impacting everyone even my mom dude. relying on an upfront cost, or donation fund allows them to not rely on preditory practices to keep you on they thing forever. software should be calm, not only in the sense that it shouldn't rely on feeding our brain the good chemicals, but that it should want to use the least amount of attention possible

we've seen a lot of people who wish to improve their relationship with technology, specifically, their phones, specifically social media. software isn't inheritly addicting.

DRM Sucks!!!

the goal of social media (and all technology really) should be to connect humans together. phones let us call, google lets us share each others ideas. other example for rule of 3

Software products by big tech can be compared to processed food. It's cheap (usually free), works well enough, and is readily avalable for you. the difference between software products from big tech and software products "good" developers is the difference between a pack of dempsters bagels and bagels from a local bakery. there are obvious differences in quality, but also in costs. and it' isn't really practical to recomend people only shop from local farmers markets. I don't know how much money you have or what food options you have nearby. 

open source software is tremendously important. even if the software doesn't rely on community contributions, or if only 1% of the actual users end up looking at the source code. It's important because people need to own the tools they rely on. When other people own the tools you rely on, you can run into issues where propeietary software devs are only concered with adding features that'll make the most money or please the investors of their company, but these features either ignore more pressing issues about the software or activley make it worse. There are some open source projects that are reaching comparable levels of quality to propietary standards in their industries (Godot vs Unity and Blender vs Maya)


Even outside of the software, the computer we run it on is also important. there's been a big fight to ensure that people are still able to repair their things, instead of being forced to send your tech to the manufacturer to get it repaired there. things are less modular and less repairable in general. Framework proved that you can make modern slim laptops without having everything soldered together, that's why I got one. Framework also gives you the schematics of the laptop!? which is still kind of absurd. sure you need to sign an NDA to view them but THEY GIVE YOU THE SCHEMATICS. 

I want files, not subscriptions, I want software that works with and respects the user, not the kind that takes advantage of them. a future with ownership and repairability could be possible, but it's important to take note of the poeple who are trying, and give them your support. Good software is important.
