I was a hacker at [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com/) this year. As my second hackathon, it was a great time, and I'd definitely come back for next year. Each hackathon I attend makes me feel exponentially more prepared and knowledgeable about hackathons, and I though I would spread what conclusions I've come to draw from this event specifically.

So here are some of the things I learned at Hack the North (abbreviated to HTN from now on), so you don't make the same mistakes as me, and make the most of your time at HTN or any other hackathon.

## 1. Find people with the same goals as you
Deciding if you'd like to treat the event like a competition or a convention is the first thing you should do. Although I will say, wanting to "take it easy" can quickly turn into "skip all the events and stay in the same room all weekend trying to finish our project" very easily due to influences from the environment. 

it's easy to want to work hard when everyone around you is (one of the reasons why people are able to be so motivated/productive), an if you get a sudden burst of motivation and decide to make somthing, that's great! Just don't treat your what should be chill project as somthing you're pushing to win somthing. Just being sourrounded by other people making things can help you make somting too, even if you aren't trying to win anything.

Don't feel bad for not wanting to skip sleep and debug deep into the early AM. If you don't want to build anything ambitious (or anything at all) and just connect with sponsors/other hackers, that's a just as valid way to treat the event. Just make sure how you'd like to go abut it aligns with your other group members. Make your goals clear.


## 2. Consider the project ahead of time (but not too much)
If you are planning on making something (or trying to WIN something), Categories for submission are usually made available before the event starts, as well as the list of sponsors that will be there. There are usually 3-5 categories, as well as 5-10 sponsor related prizes for using their stuff. If it's an [MLH](https://mlh.io/) affiliated event, they'll usually have a few prizes of their own for you to go after.

It's important to pick a 1-3 prizes/categories and target them well. Look to previous winners for inspiration but don't let it tunnel vision your idea into doing something that's already been done, novelty is very important for a stand-out project at these events. 

Decide a tech stack with your group. Don't forget the sponsor's API or database or whatever in it. This seems to be an issue with me, as I generally tend to favor the best tools over the most popular tools, that obviously being subjective. I do personally prefer minimalist tools that have the features I *need* instead of a tool with extra bloat, although these are usually less popular then the industry standard ones. (Contrarian and minimalist!?, it's the linux user in me).

It's a balance between picking tools that you all are comfortable with, but also working with people you enjoy working with (that second part is also important if you'd like to not be too sweaty at the event.) You don't want to be watching react crash course videos at 9pm trying to be able to help contribute to the front-end (we really should've just used svelte...).

Having an idea of the specific project you'd like to make would also be important, although I think doing too much specific planning kinda ruins the spirit of hackathons, somtimes it is about the seredipitous connections and ideas you're able to whip up, which kinda contradicts the first thing I said? this will all be edited before publishing anyway.


## 4. About sleep.
bring an air matteress/sleeping bag/camping cot/whatever you need to be able to get any amount of restful sleep. HTN told us that there would be sleeping arrangements, however I don't think they anticipated everyone to want to sleep so didn't get enough air matteresses??? so 3/5 of the sleeping areas had no air matteresses left. and by "areas" I mean "space on the corner of each floor next to an elevator and staircase that people will use all night"ðŸ’€ considering HTN is a student run event with over 1000 participants, I can definetly empathise with things not goig as expected or falling through the cracks. I think sleeping arangements are the most important part of your hackathon though, more than food and workshops. It's important to get right because it's very hard for idivisuals to cover themselves in the moment (especially internationals), where you could say, order food yourself, if they had run out for instance.

I guess people have finally begain to understand that coding while sleep deprved leads to diminishing returns very quickly, and sleep is extremley important in almost every aspect of health and productivity.


I think I'm especially sensitive to sleep, I try to get 8 hours every night and can't sleep on the floor. I know for some people a sleeping bag is more than enough (I've seen people sleep in nothig but those tinfoil heat retension blankets), but I don't got that dawg in me. and if you don't either, then you need to be responsible for making sure your sleep is good. use a nice mask to block out all light, use earplugs or earbuds with some brown noise, put somthing on the ground to sleep on, and try to get as much rest as you can.

## Have fun.
Hackathons should be an enjoyable time. If it's not fun, why bother (bars) 

## take all the stuff from recruiter tables
- too densly packed
- kleptomaniac tendencies
- equip it all like an rpg character
- food wasn't too bad considering the scale of the event
- the buiding was massive enough for us, gave me vertigo 
- my hackathon will have perfect sleeping arrangemets
