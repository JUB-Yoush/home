Another self indulgent "What I'm up to" post. Although considering you're on my site you're at least... a little interested in me right?

...right?

# What I've been up to (Dec 2023 - Feb 2024)

## School / Work
I'm just about halfway through my term as a software engineer on the Event Data Stream team at scotiabank. Ironically I find myself doing less development This term then last. I've been using Typescript and Playwright to do UI testing on a Next js app. The work is pretty simple and not very challenging, but I do feel more tightly intergrated to a dev team though. I'm getting my PRs approved and making tickets and participating in standups and stuff. it's cool.

My manager is currently on vacation so the director has been acting as my manager. She's very nice and is very passionate about the dept and work.

My time is being split between dev work and ...learning course creation? Honestly I don't really like doing it, and I don't feel qualified to do it. I need to learn about a team before I know what I should be putting in. but I'm getting it done. 

Unfortunately I'm coding on windows this term. It's just been in node though so it's been fine, powershell kinda sucks though. 

In terms of my summer, I got some... Hot ðŸ˜³ interviews lined up... I'll share once the offer is secured though.

I stopped doing leetcodes after I passed all the technical interviews I needed to lol, should get back into it though, shouldn't get too rusty.

Outside of work, I got accepted into the York Exchange program and have been nominated to study for a semester at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo!!!! I've always wanted to visit japan, so I'm happy I'll have an oppertunity to try living there. I'm just taking Gen-Ed credits there, going purley for vibes. 

## GDYU
The GDYU community continues to go strong. We had gotten breifly evicted from the club room, but overall I'm happy with what we got done.

Our goal was consistency and I we got that. We write things out BEFORE doing them, and have bi-weekly exec meetings. We also have some new execs to help run the club, like a dedicated social media manager

We still haven't started selling those sweaters. We need to finish the website updates to launch those as well as the zine artciles. 


York's recent stike annoucement might put a hamper on some of our plans but we ball regardless. 

- 2nd birthday party
- york started a new strike yipee
- new execs
- socials!!
- casual in person events happened
- we are working on a jam with dm dept, strike tho



## Personal Programming
Personal programming was more about changing my setup and tools used then trying to make things nessicarily. I'm a doom emacs user now incase you didn't know ðŸ¤“, and that's come with a learning curve. I also use i3 on all my linux development computers, which also has a learning curve. It's all been super fun and interesting though, and none of it is nessicary. using Gnome or kde with VSCode is fine.

Also working on a bot for the GDYU discord server which will help encourage more game development happening in GDYU.

I also have a lot of personal site updates I'd like to get through, along with the gdyu site. My mailing list is currently broken!!! but I'll fix it later lol


## Drawing
### Drawabox
Defeated Lesson 5, only took one year.

I started the 250 cylinder challenge, about 80 cylinders in. Although I'm taking a break from it untill the first page of Mercury Man (the comic I'm working on) is drawn.

### Mercury Man
