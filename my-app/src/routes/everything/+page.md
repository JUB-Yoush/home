###  <a href="https://github.com/JUB-Yoush/gdyu-site" target="_blank" >GDYU's Website</a>
#### Svelte TailwindCSS Typescript SkeletonUI
> my first svelte project and I am NEVER GOING BACK. I've done my reps with raw web development languages, and I'm ready to be *cybernetically enhanced.*
>
> This was a little frontend site I made for the game development club I founded at york University. Not only because we are on the precipice of a merchandise release and would like to have a store to display our wares, but also because Hack the North asked for a link to our projects and I thought having a site to show them would be cool. (If you're one of the people looking over my HTN application, LET ME IN PLEASE)

### <a href="https://yoush.itch.io/pdp-rpg" target="_blank" >pdp-rpg</a>
#### Godot Engine 4
> My submission for Yudum dare 3, our clubs fourth game jam (we hosted the global game jam).
> A fusion between the puzzle game Panel de Pon (Tetris attack) and a turn based rpg.
> 
> One of the most challenging things I've ever coded. I will revisit this project.

### <a href="https://github.com/JUB-Yoush/home" target="_blank" >This website</a>
#### HTML CSS JS Flask Markdown
> Simple markdown site made with Flask and is converted into a static site for github pages. Now that I've tasted the power of CHEATING (svelte + tailwindCSS) I'd definitely use that and just host on vercel. Just haven't had the chance to sit down and convert everything (busy looking for job).


### <a href="https://github.com/JUB-Yoush/express-chat-app" target="_blank" >Express Chat App</a>
#### HTML CSS JS Node.js Expressjs ejs
> a "minimalist" (I haven't finished the front-end) express and Node based chat app that has users fill in a form to create a message and passes it into backend storage. I was focused on the backend and haven't gone back to finish the front yet. Gomen. 

> Also thought I was gonna use Svelte for the front end but I found that to be quite complicated and not worth the effort for this project.

### <a>Mozilla Library App (wip)</a>
#### HTML CSS JS Node.js Expressjs Pug MongoDB Mongoose 
> Currently working through a MASSIVE tutorial written in the Mozilla web docs to make a library app
> I'm like... 80% done, just working on the edit and delete forms... stay tuned ðŸ˜³.

### <a >2 hour Scrolling shooter</a>

#### Godot Engine 3
> A project for a 3d Game mechanics course. Yes that is the Rei Plushie I really did intend on changing it for somthing else but the model just... grew on me ya know? (that and I didn't know what to replace it with).

### <a href="https://github.com/JUB-Yoush/wizgun-project" target="_blank" >Wizgun Prototype</a>
#### Godot 3
> Wizgun is a versus platformer that taught me the power and limitations of finite state machines

> Probably the most fun I had making a project (even if it is unfinished.) I kinda just added stuff I though was cool and the ideas kept coming.
> 
> I'll probably return to this someday.
